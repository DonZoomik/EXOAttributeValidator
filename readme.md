I was having some problems with Exchange Hybrid where on-prem side had been incorrectly managed without Exchange. As you probably know, all changes must be made via Exchange (or at least Exchange cmdlets these days).

This was some stuff that I put together to find out mailboxes that were inconsistent and needed fixing up. There was also a fixup script but I can't find it anymore. I'll update if I do.
